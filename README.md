# After_Internationa_Space_Station
What will happens to International Space Station when it end its service?

# Abstract:

International Space Station : What to do when end of the station , did we going to burn in the Atmosphere like the Mir Station or there other options available .

# Possibility :  

Used the Station to research the effect of radiation in the long time  outside of Earth per√≠metro.  This include radiation inside of living quarter and possible different protection for radiation (radiation bunker) , effect of radiation for equipment important to live support and keeping long duration living quarter .  Move the station to outside of the protection of planet Earth magnetic field , this include keep the station near moon or/and used it to travel with not personal to Mar . 

Used for Emergency Location Away from Planet Earth . possible location will be near or in the moon , mars and venus . If we going to the Moon or Mars , it will be used like secondary (only for emergency ) occupancy for astronaut  , In case that the mar or moon spacecraft/station present a imminent failure that will make impossible for astronaut to survive and will need to be rescue . The station will be used for point to wait for rescue operation or secondary spacecraft   reach location . 

Crash land the International Space Station on the Moon or Mars . Any future human colony in the moon or mars will need the recycling of material of different spacecraft that reach end of their useful life . The international Space Station material will be used  on the Moon/Mars base . (space recycling )

This can be used like model of future expansion in our solar system . We can build station at planet orbit and them  used for some time on orbit ,  move them to the next location (Mar,Moon, Venus, etc) for secondary  used , and 3rd we recycle it on that location to be part of building the permanent human colony . 

What needed to make possible: We need ion or nuclear engine to move Space Station between earth and the other location . This Engine can be remove and used in different spacecraft or to move asteroid if needed . nota the Space Station will have their own ion engine to keep location or correction of orbit .
